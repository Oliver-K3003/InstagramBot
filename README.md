# InstagramBot

The purpose of this bot is to promote and grow a new account

This bot scrubs a search term indicated by the user, then clicks on posts with the most likes.
It then finds accounts that like these posts and follows and sends them a random message from a list input by the user.
This data is checked to ensure that the limits of likes, follows, and messages are not exceeding Instagram's limits which reduces the likelyhood of an account ban.
